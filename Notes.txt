Create a game area
Just boundaries of how far the agents can walk in every direction.

Blackboard
	Ints
	Vectors
	BlackBoard*

Healer
	Can heal the tank or themselves
	Can damage monsters with magic

Tank
	Draws enmity from the monsters
	Somehow saves the healer if they need it

Monsters
	I don't like goblins


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Goblin behaviour tree needs to reduce enmity against both humans by 1 every .5f seconds
I might need to change angent id's to start at 1 due to the map defaulting to setting a value to 0
You need to set the id number in the blackboard of the tank and mage at least

If we hard limit the amount of goblins to 10 it makes the idea of getting all living goblins easier
When something dies it need to unbind itself from the global blackboard. It also needs to delete itself since it is a newed thing. Might not apply to the humans.
